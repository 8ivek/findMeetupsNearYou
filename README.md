# Find Meetups Near You
## Description
I always wanted to attend meetups in my free times (after my office or before) but meetup.com do not have feature to select time interval, so I created this application.
This application gets events between given **start time** and **end time**, around given **radius** and in your current **latitude**.

*note: the application gets all the weekend events regardless of time.*  

### Arguments accepted
### URL params supported:
* **radius**        = 1
* **latitude**      = 43.668758
* **start_time**    = urlencode(7:30 pm) (time you are free in evenings) 
* **end_time**      = urlencoded(7:30 am) (time before which you are free on mornings)
 
### Example URL:
meetup.php?radius=1&latitude=43.668758&start_time=7%3A30%20pm&end_time=7%3A30%20am
